# Console-game---Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is a simple console game and my first project - "Rock Paper Scissors"

* Project goals
The project goals to create a simple console game "Rock paper Scissors", where the user can play it against the computer

* Solution
I use Scanner to be able for the user to input his choise and Random to make sure computer will choose random 0, 1 or 2, combined with "Switch-case" (0 for rock, 1 for paper and 2 for scissors). For the results (Win or Lose) I used "If-else if" statements. The user can choise r or rock, p or paper, s or scissors and of course q or quit (for exit). When the user quit the game, the results are printed out - how many wins and loses he had, during the game.
